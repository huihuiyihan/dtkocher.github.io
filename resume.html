          <h2>Application Developer at Scrip-Safe</h2>
          <p class="subDetails">Janruary 2012 – August 2014</p>
          <h3>Job Description:</h3>
          <p>
            Develop the Ruby on Rails dynamic web applications Transcripts on Demand and eSCRIP-SAFE.
            The Transcripts on Demand dynamic web application is used by students (past and present) to
            order transcripts either to be sent electronically to an in-network school or by paper to themselves
            or another third party. eSCRIP-SAFE is used by a schools registration office to send and receive
            transcripts electronically in a safe and secure manner.
          </p>
          <h3>Job Responsibilities:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Develop new back-end features and enhancements using the Ruby on Rails framework.</li>
            <li>Develop new front-end features and enhancements using the JQuery and JQuery UI
              javascript libraries.</li>
            <li>Manage the Postgres databases with Ruby on Rails' ActiveRecord to create migrations
              and manage interactions between the applications and the databases.</li>
            <li>Helping to manage deployments via Capistrano.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Projects of Note:</h3>
          <ul>
           <li>Writing a Capistrano script to manage the deployment of Transcripts on Demand to all
             the different QA, Staging, and Production environments.</li>
           <li>Developing a web interface using Ruby on Rails that allows the Customer Support team
             to set up clients in QA/Staging environments. In turn allowing full functional testing or
             demos and then easily moving them into Production.</li>
           <li>Working with a third party vendor to create a web-service to integrate eSCRIP-SAFE with
             their system via both a Restful API (on the Scrip-Safe side) and a SOAP API (on the
             vendors side). The resulting product of this project was to have the ability for the third
             party vendor's schools system to send us transcripts, for eSCRIP-SAFE to parse the
             transcripts, to update the third party with data extracted from the transcripts, and then to
             send the transcripts to the desired institution.</li>
           <li>Creating a service which we called the Vault. This is a service that allows Scrip-Safe to
             store all of the transcripts that are sent to them in a server agnostic format. The transcripts
             can be stored on the server, in the cloud or anywhere else we need as a vault location.
             This project was developed using Ruby on Rails back end and CarrierWave to store the
             file either to Amazon S3 or to any local destination. Interaction with the Vault is done via
             a Restful API.</li>

            Develop the J2EE dynamic web application LMS+. This dynamic web application is used by law
            firms to track time entry and client needs for bill pay and accounting purposes. It contains many
            reports, dashboards and data entry pages to help the law firm in making better and more precise
            business decisions to both help the company and their clients.

            <li>Develop front-end features using the ExtJS java-script UI library to help give LMS+ not

          <h3>Project of Note:</h3>
          <p>
            I was assigned to come up with an automated testing platform to perform regression tests.
            Through this I gained experience using both Canoo Web Test and Selenium. I designed a
            framework around the basic Selenium scripting which allows tests to be written with less code.
            This in turn helps the writing of test cases to not be so burdensome, especially when dealing with
            the dynamic interfaces designed with ExtJS.
