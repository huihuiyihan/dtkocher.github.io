        Who am I?  Well in my personal time I am a father, husband and friend.
        The thing I enjoy the most is being with my family. I have a little girl,
        McKenzie, that is my whole life and a beautiful wife, Tiffany. I love doing
        anything with them whether it be sitting at home on the couch watching a movie,
        or going to the park pushing McKenzie on the swings and helping her down a slide.
        I also love doing anything dealing with sports. I love watching sports where I am
        an avid fan of college football and the Purdue Boilermakers in particular. I have
        also enjoyed coaching middle school football in the past.  Other than family and
        sports I love hanging out with my friends whether it be at the bar or just hanging
        out joking around.

        I am a software developer by trade having done so professionally for over seven
        years and having dabbled in development for around 10 years.  I love to build software
        solutions that not only look nice, but help better the world we live in.  I love
        developing software using both Ruby on Rails and Java for the Server Side backend
        and AngularJS, HTML5, CSS, JQuery UI, and Twitter Bootstrap to give those applications
        a professional look and feel from the client side. I am a graduate of Northern Kentucky University,
        graduating with Magna Cum Laude honors and a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science.
